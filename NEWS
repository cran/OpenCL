NEWS for the OpenCL package

0.1-2	2012-03-07
    o	add the support for asynchronous calls, i.e., execution
	parallel to the CPU or multiple parallel GPU operations.
	This is done by using x <- oclRun(..., wait=FALSE) to
	dispatch the kernel and then oclResult(x) to collect the
	results later.

    o	minor cleanup


0.1-1	2011-08-09
    o	improve memory management and clean up on error in oclRun()

    o	use CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR instead of clEnqueueWriteBuffer() for
	better performance on large input vectors

    o	add support for native single precision representation
	(see ?clFloat and native.result argument in oclRun())

    o	added INSTALL file with links to common OpenCL implementations


0.1-0	2011-08-08
    o	first public release

	includes support for single and double precision computations
	as well as simple kernels (one output vector, arbitrary input)
